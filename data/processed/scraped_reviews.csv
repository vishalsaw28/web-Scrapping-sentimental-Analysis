e202d01a,These are perfect.,"Customer rating: 5 out of 5 starsThese are perfect.Reviewed byAmazing- November 17, 2024These are awesome, the noise cancellation is great but the ability to go into transparency is amazing. Whenever things are to loud I can either silence it or make it so it’s not deafening while still hearing my surroundings. The seamless connecting, the ease of calls & controls just blows me away! Amazing to think about when I used to walk about with a MP3 player that used discs with some bad earphones. I’m 25 now and it’s amazing how good tech is becoming.

I guess you get what you pay for. The fantastic AirPods Pro 2nd Generation delivers some of the strongest noise cancellation performance of any earphones. Super easy to setup, Connects & switches in seconds between Apple devices w/o having to go to Bluetooth settings and the distance Bluetooth strength is amazing so the quality is just amazing.

986da69b,Find My AirPods Is Basically Useless,"Customer rating: 2 out of 5 starsFind My AirPods Is Basically UselessReviewed byMatt- September 24, 2025I don’t get the hype around Apple’s Find My feature for AirPods. I’ve held the case up to my iPhone, opened the app, and even took the AirPods out while it was trying to find them — and it still said “looking for signal.” They were literally inches from the phone. It’s infuriating because the app gives you the impression it’ll actually help you locate them, but in real use it often does nothing. The case has a speaker, the AirPods are charged, everything’s working,",,2.0,BestBuy Canada,Anonymous,-0.22500000000000003,0.35000000000000003,Negative
